# Taximeter
In this assignment on [Patika.dev](https://patika.dev), we were asked to write a taximeter program in Java.

The program has these features: 

- The taximeter charges $2.20 per km.
- The minimum fare is $20; any amount below this will still be charged as $20. 
- The starting fare of the taxi is $10.
